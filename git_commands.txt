**git log:** shows a history of commits in terminal
**git log --stat** shows a history of commits across a repository in terminal
(i.e. across files)
**git diff id1 id2** shows the difference between two commits
**git clone URL** to clone a repository from github
**git checkout id** takes you back to an older version, but committing this can
overwrite any changes made since
**git init** creates a .git (. means hidden) file to turn something into a
repository
**git status** gives you the status of the directory
**git add** adds files to the staging area (ready to be committed)
**git commit -m "Commit Message"** lets you commit from staging area to the
repository, and add a message to it. The message is optional but recommended
**Commit message format**: Ideal format has *type: subject* (i.e. feature, bug
docs, style, refactor, test), *body* (detailed description of changes), and
*footer* (reference issues e.g. #123)
