**Viewing a diff between two versions** helped to identify which things had been
changed. From there it was possible to see which changes were expected, and
which weren't, as well as shrinking down the number of lines needed to review

**Easy access to file history** can help correct mistakes, and understand the
history of the development of a piece of code. To correct mistakes, if something
no longer works, you can compare it with an older version of the code that was
clean. Reviewing old code also helps you understand the context of the current
code base. Finally, if you deprecated some code, but want to bring it back, you
can review historic versions rather than rewriting it

**Advantage of manual commits** is that they should always sit at a logical
break point, which means that when you look back over the history, each commit
can be useful to review, rather than clutter. It also means you don't commit
code that is half complete and that won't compile properly. However, it can
also result in you not committing often enough, allowing complexity to creep
into your code

**Saving multiple files in 1 commit** is helpful to ensure consistency across
related files (and also more efficient than saving each individually)
