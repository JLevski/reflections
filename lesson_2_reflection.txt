**Initialising a reflection** allows you to create a repository and start
tracking changes in it

Your files are initially in a working directory. You can add files to the
staging area with git add, which has them ready to be committed

**Staging area** lets you break up your commits into logical chunks, making
it easier to trace what changes were made. It also forms a middleground before
actually committing work
